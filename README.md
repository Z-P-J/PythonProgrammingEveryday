Python编程每日一题

## 目录

day1. [一球从100米高度自由落下，每次落地后反跳回原高度的一半；再落下，求它在第10次落地时，共经过多少米？第10次反弹多高？](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day1)

day2. [打印出所有的“水仙花数”，所谓“水仙花数”是指一个三位数，其各位数字立方和等于该数本身。例如：153是一个“水仙花数”，因为153=1的三次方＋5的三次方＋3的三次方](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day2)

day3. [有1、2、3、4个数字，能组成多少个互不相同且无重复数字的三位数？都是多少？](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day3)

day4. [编写一个函数判断一个数是否是奇数，并判断101-200之间有多少个素数，并输出所有素数](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day4)

day5. [将一个正整数分解质因数。例如：输入90,打印出90=2*3*3*5。](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day5)

day6. [输入一行字符，分别统计出其中英文字母、空格、数字和其它字符的个数。](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day6)

day7. [求s=a+aa+aaa+aaaa+aa...a的值，其中a是一个数字。例如2+22+222+2222+22222(此时共有5个数相加)，几个数相加有键盘控制。](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day7)

day8. [一个数如果恰好等于它的因子之和，这个数就称为“完数”。例如6=1＋2＋3.编程找出1000以内的所有完数。](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day8)

day9. [Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day9)

day10. [Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day10)

day11. [With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day11)

day12. [Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day12)

day13. [Define a class which has at least two methods: getString: to get a string from console input printString: to print the string in upper case. Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day13)

day14. [Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day14)

day15. [Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day15)

day16. [Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day16)

day17. [Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day17)

day18. [Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.](https://github.com/Z-P-J/PythonProgrammingEveryday/blob/master/src/day18)
